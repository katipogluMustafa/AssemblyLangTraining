## Overflow Exercises

For each problem, perform the addition or subtraction operation, giving the sum or difference in hex using the same number of hex digits as the original two operands. 

* For each operation,
    * state whether or not overflow occurs. 
* For each sum, 
    * state whether or not there is a carry; 
* For each difference,
    * state whether or not there is a borrow. 
    
* For each problem, interpret the operations as 2’s complement signed and convert the problem to the equivalent decimal problem; verify that the signed interpretation is correct when there is no overflow. 
* For each problem, interpret the operands as unsigned and convert the problem to the equivalent decimal problem; verify that the unsigned interpretation is correct when there is no carry (borrow for subtraction).
